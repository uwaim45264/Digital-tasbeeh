# Flutter Digital Tasbeeh Application

A **Digital Tasbeeh** counter app built using **Flutter**. This app allows users to track and save their tasbeeh count history with a simple and modern UI. It provides smooth animations, haptic feedback for button presses, and the ability to reset or save the count. The app uses **SharedPreferences** to store the tasbeeh count history, and it includes a history screen where users can review and manage their saved counts.

## Features

- **Increment Tasbeeh Count:** Users can tap a large button to increment the tasbeeh count, with a satisfying bounce animation and haptic feedback.
- **Save Count:** Save the current tasbeeh count to the app's history.
- **Reset Count:** Reset the current tasbeeh count to zero.
- **View History:** Review all saved tasbeeh counts in the history screen.
- **Delete History Item:** Delete specific history entries or clear the entire history.
- **Smooth Animations:** Bounce and scale animations for enhanced user interaction.
- **Persistent Storage:** Uses **SharedPreferences** to store the count history, which is retained even after app restarts.
- **Responsive UI:** The app's design adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
